✈️ Airline Customer Experience Analysis & Priority RecommenderProject OverviewThis project frames a business problem around prioritizing customer complaints, executes a full text mining workflow (preprocessing, topic modeling, severity analysis), and delivers a content-based recommendation system to surface the most urgent and relevant negative tweets for immediate customer service action. The analysis focuses exclusively on the 9,178 negative tweets found in the datasets.                                             🎯 Problem Framing                                                                                                                                                               Business Question                                                                                                                                                              What are the primary negative themes driving poor customer experiences across airlines, and which tweets related to these themes should customer service teams prioritize for immediate response and resolution?
2. & 3. 📊 Data Import & Text PreprocessingThe initial step confirmed a heavy imbalance toward negative sentiment.
